# Hytale Username Checker

A streaming username availability checker for Hytale using Node.js.  
It reads nicknames from `generated_nicks.txt` and saves available ones to `available.txt`.

## Features

- Stream-based checking of usernames from a text file
- Supports 3- and 4-character nicknames with letter-to-number substitutions
- Saves available nicknames to `available.txt`
- Clean terminal logging
- Supports `.env` file for Hytale cookies

## Algorithm

The nickname generation algorithm works as follows:

1. **Alphabet-based combinations:**

   - Nicknames are generated using letters from a defined alphabet (`a`–`z`).

2. **Length range:**

   - Generates nicknames with lengths between `min` and `max` (configurable, typically 3–4 characters).

3. **Letter substitutions:**

   - Each letter can be replaced with a number according to a `letters_replace` mapping, e.g.:
     - `a → 4`
     - `b → 8`
     - `e → 3`
     - `i → 1`
     - `l → 1`
     - `o → 0`
     - `s → 5`
     - `t → 7`
     - `z → 2`

4. **Combinatorial generation:**

   - All possible combinations of letters and substitutions are generated recursively (or via a generator) to create a complete nickname dictionary.
   - This allows for variants like: `aaa`, `aa4`, `aab`, `a8b`, etc.

5. **Streaming processing:**
   - Nicknames are not all stored in memory.
   - They are read/generated line by line and immediately processed for availability, which allows handling huge nickname lists efficiently.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- `.env` file in the project root containing your Hytale cookie:

```env
HYTALE_COOKIE=your_cookie_here
```

- `generated_nicks.txt` file in the project root, for example generated by the nickname generator

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/hytale-checker.git
cd hytale-checker
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Hytale cookie.

## Usage

Run the checker using:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The checker will:

1. Read usernames line by line from `generated_nicks.txt`
2. Wait 3 seconds between each request
3. Save available usernames to `available.txt`
4. Log progress in the terminal

## Notes

- The checker is **stream-based**, so it can handle very large nickname files without consuming excessive memory.
- You can adjust the interval between requests by changing the `INTERVAL_MS` constant in the code.
